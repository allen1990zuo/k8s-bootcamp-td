# Installing Openshift Origin on Azure #

Openshift is deployed via Ansible onto VMs on Azure.  Therefore, you first need to define the VNet/Subnet, create all the necessary VMs prior to installing Openshift.  See the docs below.  Note, [managed Openshift on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/blog/openshift-on-azure-the-easiest-fully-managed-openshift-in-the-cloud/) is currently in private preview and will make deploying and operating Openshift on Azure much, much simpler.
