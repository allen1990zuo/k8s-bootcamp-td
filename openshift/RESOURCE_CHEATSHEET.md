# Comparison between Kubernetes and Openshift Resources

Openshift is built on top of Kubernetes and hence support the fundamental "desired state" model of Kubernetes.  In addition, this desired state is specified using API resources.  Although Openshift leverages the core Kubernetes resources such as Pods, Services, etc, it adds additional resources that do not exist in core Kubernetes.  This sections describes those resources and provides links to their documentation.
