Ambassador is an open source, Kubernetes-native microservices API gateway built on the Envoy Proxy. Ambassador is built from the ground up to support multiple, independent teams that need to rapidly publish, monitor, and update services for end users. Ambassador can also be used to handle the functions of a Kubernetes ingress controller and load balancer.
